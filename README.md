# DATA-CLASSIFICATION-IN-HEALTHCARE
Java app on a Hadoop YARN cluster to process patient-record CSVs in HDFS. Reads/writes data, sorts and groups into three outputs (by NHS number, symptoms, and NHS Trust region). Includes flexible search by NHS number, symptoms (case-insensitive) or region. Built and tested on Azure Linux VM.
